## About

<p>a game called snake. Here you have to eat apples until you occupy all the space. I think everyone is familiar with this game. I decided to implement it using tkinter and then you can see what came out of it. I wonâ€™t lie, I took some parts of the code from outside, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GTai_School/featured">guy</a> especially helped. The only drawback that I found during the game is that there is a chance that food will appear inside your body, which is why you will have to wait a little. I probably spent a day thinking about how to fix this and came up with nothing useful. If you have any ideas, I'm waiting for help!</p>
